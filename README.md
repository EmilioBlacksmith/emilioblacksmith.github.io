## A minimalistic personal portfolio website

This Project is a Web App to showcase my recent projects and personal information for both job hunting and to share others what I'm currently working on. It was made from scratch using different design principles, and softly based on portfolio websites I gather online as reference such as [Eric Van Holtz Portfolio Website](https://vanholtz.co/).

The main focus for this project was to:

* Showcase with a minimalistic design some main projects I've work on recently.
* Make somewhat of an overview of my skills and what I do as a Web Developer.
* Learn different Javascript and REACT features, to make an appealing user experience, from dark mode, to scrolling animations.

## The Design Process behind this Project

Based on the [Eric Van Holtz Portfolio Website](https://vanholtz.co/) as key reference, I decided to design this website using the same principles using Figma.

I decided to keep the footer and header always visible for the user, and both have different use cases, in the case of the header I have the Logo and the toggle to update the Website's Theme based on the preference of the user, either dark or light mode.

In the Footer's case I decided to keep it simple with a Navigation menu and 3 main links that are important for me to share, my youtube, my blog and my [bioLink project](https://emilioblacksmith.github.io/bioLink/).

The only thing that it's been updated in the website with the scrolling are three main sections:

* the Hero Section that showcases an overview of the Tech Stack that I use, to a direct overview of who am I.

* The Portfolio Section that focuses only to show 4 main and recent projects, showcasing a bit visually the name of the projects, and explanation and a small video that shows the project.

* The More Section is to showcase everything else that I do, besides my work as a Software Developer, in this case Youtube and Blog Writing.

That would be the explanation behind the Design Process of this Project.
